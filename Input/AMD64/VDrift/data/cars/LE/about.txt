LE

model by Ny Dedes
settings adapted from xs, sound from xs as well.


giving the headlights and interior some treatment atm.
roof and wiper intended as prototypes for multiple-meshes per car.
side mirrors intended as prototypes for damage.

tried to get the mass and torque curve correct.  doesn't drive well yet though.
those more knowledgeable should change/tune to get it to groove.
